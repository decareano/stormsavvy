          Storm Savvy automates SWPPP compliance practices in the
          construction industry. Every time it rains, project
          managers face the potential of six-figure fines if
          they fail to generate and manage the correct reports
          to track water run off and potential site pollution.
          Storm Savvy collects environmental data and creates
          and tracks reporting in real time based on geographic
          specific weather events on a site-by-site basis.
