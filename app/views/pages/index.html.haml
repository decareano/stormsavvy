          Storm Savvy automates SWPPP compliance practices in the construction industry. 
          Every time it rains, project managers face the potential of six-figure fines
          if they fail to generate and manage the correct reports to track water run off
          and potential site pollution. Storm Savvy collects environmental data and creates 
          and tracks reporting in real time based on geographic specific weather events
          on a site-by-site basis.
